# DESCRIPTION 
I have successfully implemented IAM policies and secured cloud storage using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as part of my internship at CodTech. I created a customer-managed policy named "readonlyaccess121" to provide secure and restricted access to an S3 bucket named "securestorage121". The policy allows read-only permissions using the actions s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket, ensuring users can access files without the ability to modify or delete them.

The policy JSON was configured to restrict access to the specific bucket and its contents by defining the appropriate Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). This helps enforce the principle of least privilege, a key cloud security practice. The policy has been attached to IAM entities as required to limit access while maintaining secure visibility of data. This setup satisfies the deliverable to configure security policies and represents a key step in enforcing cloud storage security and data protection.
